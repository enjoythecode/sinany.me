## <span className="rainbow-text">Getting Started</span>

Amazons is an abstract strategy game -- in the same category of games as Chess and Go. However, it is *much* simpler to learn and get playing. The simple rules hide deep strategic complexity, and
within 5 minutes, you'll be able to play the game and appreciate some of its intricate strategies!

Here is the entirety of the rules for this game, in five bullet points;

*TODO: add rainbow border here!*
<b>
1. Amazons is (most often) played on a 10x10 square grid.

2. The two players (colored white and black) each control four pieces called Queens (or Amazons).

3. Starting with the white player, players take turns moving one of their queens in a valid path, and then shoot at another square from there over a valid path.
A valid path is an  horizontal, vertical, or diagonal sequence of only empty squares.

4. The squares that were shot at becomes a permanent obstruction for later moves and shots for both players.

5. The last player to be able to make a move, <span className="rainbow-text">wins</span>!

## Breaking the Rules Down

Those are the rules, presented densely. I will now explain each bullet point with examples.

### 1. The board

TODO: talk about the board; coordinates, mention "chess-like"

### 2. The pieces

TODO: show the initial configuration of pieces, tell that the icon is borrowed from chess [1]
1: footnote: the idea to borrow the queen icon came from this Numberphile video (link to there)

### 3. Movement

TODO: give starting board, but interactive! guide them through the first move; have them be able to control both players
