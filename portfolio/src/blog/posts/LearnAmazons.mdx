<PlaybackAmazonsBoard></PlaybackAmazonsBoard>

Playback TODO:
- add some breathing room between the players and the move list
- annotate players with the color they are playing
- link to LG.net
- have controls for stopping/pausing play
- have control for restarting the playback
- show who won in the end
- correct how the move is used (if current, has it played? if so, how do we handle moveIndex == -1? etc.)

## <span className="rainbow-text">Getting Started</span>

Amazons is an abstract strategy game -- in the same category of games as Chess and Go.
However, it is *much* simpler to learn and get playing. The simple rules hide deep strategic complexity, and
within 5 minutes, you'll be able to play the game and appreciate some of its intricate strategies!

Here is the entirety of the rules for this game, in five bullet points;

*TODO: add rainbow border here!*
<b>
1. Amazons is (most often) played on a 10x10 square grid.

2. The two players (colored white and black) each control four pieces called Queens (or Amazons).

3. Starting with the white player, players take turns moving one of their queens in a valid path, and then shoot at another square from there over a valid path.
A valid path is an  horizontal, vertical, or diagonal sequence of only empty squares.

4. The squares that were shot at becomes a permanent obstruction for later moves and shots for both players.

5. The last player to be able to make a move, <span className="rainbow-text">wins</span>!

## Breaking the Rules Down

Those are the rules, presented densely. I will now explain each bullet point with examples.
You can also <a href="#playground" className="rainbow-link">skip ahead to the playground</a> if you'd like!

TODO: write a component for putting content on the right half of the column 

### 1. The board

The board is a simple, 10 by 10 square grid. We can assign letters to the columns and 
numbers to the rows for our notation, just like in chess. In this case, the 
left-most column is "A", all the way through column J at the right-edge. Similarly,
we number the rows 1 through 10, starting from the bottom.

TODO: chess-board with row/col highlighting on mouse-over

### 2. The pieces

Each player is always in control of 4 queens throughout a game of Amazons;
there is no capturing of pieces, nor any way to put more pieces into play.
The initial, symettrical configuration of pieces is shown on the right.

TODO: tell that the icon for the queens, and the shot squares being fires, is 
borrowed from Numberphile

### 3. Movement

The player with the turn makes one move with one of their queens in two steps.
First, the queen moves, and then it shoots. For both of these actions, the path
from the starting location to the target location must be an empty path going
horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Both of these steps are mandatory, and
the queen must move before it shoots.

TODO: give starting board, but interactive! guide them through the first move; have them be able to control both players

</div>

### 4. Blocked squares

Choosing where to shoot is a major strategic decision; that square will be inaccessible
for the rest of the game. Whether it blocks your movement or your opponents down the line
will have major consequences for the rest of the game, and this is what makes each move in 
a game of Amazons so consequential!

TODO: give a starting board with a few moves made. showcase how some arrows and queen positioning can be blockages

### 5. Winning!

You win the game if you are able to make the last move. Amazons is a 
wrestle of the minds, and you win if you are able to constrict your opponent to
not be able to make any more moves. In this example board, try winning against the bot
with your remaining moves!

TODO: give a guaranteed win-in-2 moves board against the bot. bot makes their last possible move; and then sparkles and you win!

## Playground <a name="playground"></a>

I love Amazons' simplicity; that is all the rules of the game, and you are ready to play now!
