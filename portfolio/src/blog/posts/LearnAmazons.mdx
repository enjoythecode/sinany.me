# <span className="rainbow-text">An Interactive Introduction to the Game of Amazons</span>
##### i love this niche strategy game, and i want to tell you about it

Amazons is an abstract strategy game -- in the same category of games as Chess and Go.
It is really simple to learn and get playing. You can learn the simple rules within a few minutes,
and begin to appreciate some of Amazons' intricate strategies!

If you are the kind of person who likes figuring things on their own, see if you
can figure out the rules of the game by checking out the playback below.

## <span className="rainbow-text">Getting Started</span>

Here is the entirety of the rules for this game, in five bullet points;

<div style={{border: "white 3px solid", animation: "animateRainbowBorderColor 10s linear infinite", padding: "5px"}}>

<b>
1. Amazons is (most often) played on a 10x10 square grid.

2. The two players (colored white and black) each control four pieces called Queens (or Amazons).

3. Starting with the white player, players take turns moving one of their queens in a valid path, and then shoot at another square from there over a valid path.
A valid path is an  horizontal, vertical, or diagonal sequence of only empty squares.

4. The squares that were shot at becomes a permanent obstruction for later moves and shots for both players.

5. The last player to be able to make a move, <span className="rainbow-text">wins</span>!

## Breaking the Rules Down

That was the entirety of the rules for the game, presented densely. I will now explain each bullet point with examples.
You can also <a href="#playground" className="rainbow-link">skip ahead to the playground</a> if you'd like!

### 1. The board
<SideBySideContent left={<p>The board is a simple, 10 by 10 square grid. We can assign letters to the columns and 
numbers to the rows for our notation, just like in chess. In this case, the 
left-most column is "A", all the way through column J at the right-edge. Similarly,
we number the rows 1 through 10, starting from the bottom.
<br/><br/>
You can hover your mouse over the board to the right to see where the coordinates intersect!</p>} right={(<AmazonsBoardDisplayColumns></AmazonsBoardDisplayColumns>)}>
</SideBySideContent>

### 2. The pieces

Each player is always in control of 4 queens throughout a game of Amazons;
there is no capturing of pieces, nor any way to put more pieces into play.
The initial, symettrical configuration of pieces is shown on the right.

TODO: tell that the icon for the queens, and the shot squares being fires, is 
borrowed from Numberphile

### 3. Movement

The player with the turn makes one move with one of their queens in two steps.
First, the queen moves, and then it shoots. For both of these actions, the path
from the starting location to the target location must be an empty path going
horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Both of these steps are mandatory, and
the queen must move before it shoots.

TODO: give starting board, but interactive! guide them through the first move; have them be able to control both players

    <SinglePlayerAmazonsBoard></SinglePlayerAmazonsBoard>
</div>

### 4. Blocked squares

Choosing where to shoot is a major strategic decision; that square will be inaccessible
for the rest of the game. Whether it blocks your movement or your opponents down the line
will have major consequences for the rest of the game, and this is what makes each move in 
a game of Amazons so consequential!

TODO: give a starting board with a few moves made. showcase how some arrows and queen positioning can be blockages

### 5. Winning!

You win the game if you are able to make the last move. Amazons is a 
wrestle of the minds, and you win if you are able to constrict your opponent to
not be able to make any more moves. In this example board, try winning against the bot
with your remaining moves!

TODO: give a guaranteed win-in-2 moves board against the bot. bot makes their last possible move; and then sparkles and you win!

- emergence in the rules of Amazons
    - explain roughly what emergence is and why I find it elegant
    - look around for others who have written on emergence: "what makes abstract strategy board games good"

- implications
    - first: once boards are independent, only count number of moves available (high-level resigns early)
    - second: game theory talks about how we merge "sub-games" (independent areas of the board that are blocked off)
        - "zukz" -- can't count every square; sometimes you can't use everything
